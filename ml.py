In response, Bob Kane created the BatMan.6 Collaborator Bill Finger recalled that Kane had an idea for a character called Batman, and hed like me to see the drawings. I went over to Kanes, and he had drawn a character who looked very much like Superman with kind of ...reddish tights, I believe, with boots ...no gloves, no gauntlets ...with a small domino mask, swinging on a rope. He had two stiff wings that were sticking out, looking like bat wings. And under it was a big sign ...BATMAN.7 The batwinglike cape was suggested by Bob Kane, inspired as a child by Leonardo da Vincis sketch of an ornithopter flying device.8Finger suggested giving the character a cowl instead of a simple domino mask, a cape instead of wings, and gloves he also recommended removing the red sections from the original costume.9101112 Finger said he devised the name Bruce Wayne for the characters secret identity Bruce Waynes first name came from Robert the Bruce, the Scottish patriot. Wayne, being a playboy, was a man of gentry. I searched for a name that would suggest colonialism. I tried Adams, Hancock ...then I thought of Mad Anthony Wayne.13 He later said his suggestions were influenced by Lee Falks popular The Phantom, a syndicated newspaper comicstrip character with which Kane was also familiar.14Kane and Finger drew upon contemporary 1930s popular culture for inspiration regarding much of the BatMans look, personality, methods, and weaponry. Details find predecessors in pulp fiction, comic strips, newspaper headlines, and autobiographical details referring to Kane himself.15 As an aristocratic hero with a double identity, Batman had predecessors in the Scarlet Pimpernel created by Baroness Emmuska Orczy, 1903 and Zorro created by Johnston McCulley, 1919. Like them, Batman performed his heroic deeds in secret, averted suspicion by playing aloof in public, and marked his work with a signature symbol. Kane noted the influence of the films The Mark of Zorro 1920 and The Bat Whispers 1930 in the creation of the characters iconography. Finger, drawing inspiration from pulp heroes like Doc Savage, The Shadow, Dick Tracy, and Sherlock Holmes, made the character a master sleuth.1617In his 1989 autobiography, Kane detailed Fingers contributions to Batmans creationOne day I called Bill and said, I have a new character called the BatMan and Ive made some crude, elementary sketches Id like you to look at. He came over and I showed him the drawings. At the time, I only had a small domino mask, like the one Robin later wore, on Batmans face. Bill said, Why not make him look more like a bat and put a hood on him, and take the eyeballs out and just put slits for eyes to make him look more mysterious At this point, the BatMan wore a red union suit the wings, trunks, and mask were black. I thought that red and black would be a good combination. Bill said that the costume was too bright Color it dark grey to make it look more ominous. The cape looked like two stiff bat wings attached to his arms. As Bill and I talked, we realized that these wings would get cumbersome when BatMan was in action and changed them into a cape, scalloped to look like bat wings when he was fighting or swinging down on a rope. Also, he didnt have any gloves on, and we added them so that he wouldnt leave fingerprints.14Golden AgeSubsequent creation creditKane signed away ownership in the character in exchange for, among other compensation, a mandatory byline on all Batman comics. This byline did not originally say Batman created by Bob Kane his name was simply written on the title page of each story. The name disappeared from the comic book in the mid1960s, replaced by credits for each storys actual writer and artists. In the late 1970s, when Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster began receiving a created by credit on the Superman titles, along with William Moulton Marston being given the byline for creating Wonder Woman, Batman stories began saying Created by Bob Kane in addition to the other credits.Finger did not receive the same recognition. While he had received credit for other DC work since the 1940s, he began, in the 1960s, to receive limited acknowledgment for his Batman writing in the letters page of Batman 169 February 1965 for example, editor Julius Schwartz names him as the creator of the Riddler, one of Batmans recurring villains. However, Fingers contract left him only with his writing page rate and no byline. Kane wrote, Bill was disheartened by the lack of major accomplishments in his career. He felt that he had not used his creative potential to its fullest and that success had passed him by.13 At the time of Fingers death in 1974, DC had not officially credited Finger as Batman cocreator.Jerry Robinson, who also worked with Finger and Kane on the strip at this time, has criticized Kane for failing to share the credit. He recalled Finger resenting his position, stating in a 2005 interview with The Comics JournalBob made him more insecure, because while he slaved working on Batman, he wasnt sharing in any of the glory or the money that Bob began to make, which is why ...he was going to leave Kanes employ. ...Kane should have credited Bill as cocreator, because I know I was there. ...That was one thing I would never forgive Bob for, was not to take care of Bill or recognize his vital role in the creation of Batman. As with Siegel and Shuster, it should have been the same, the same cocreator credit in the strip, writer, and artist.18Although Kane initially rebutted Fingers claims at having created the character, writing in a 1965 open letter to fans that it seemed to me that Bill Finger has given out the impression that he and not myself created the Batman, t sic as well as Robin and all the other leading villains and characters. This statement is fraudulent and entirely untrue. Kane himself also commented on Fingers lack of credit. The trouble with being a ghost writer or artist is that you must remain rather anonymously without credit. However, if one wants the credit, then one has to cease being a ghost or follower and become a leader or innovator.19I
